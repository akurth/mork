<p>Push down automatons for shift-reduce parsing.</p>

<p>LALR(1) construction follows the algorithm shown in [DeRemer79]. I did not read this paper,
instead the desciption in [Sorenson84] was used. Most compiler text books (e.g. [Waite84], [Aho86],[Wilhelm92])
do not include a description of this algorithm.</p>

TODO:
o error repair
  o recover from syntax errors
  o improved error messages
  o Toplas 17(4)
  o use the same declarations for scanner and parser
  o provide automatic of declared messages
