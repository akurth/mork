<p>LR(1) and LALR(1) parser construction.</p>

<p>LALR(1) construction follows the algorithm shown in [DeRemer79]. I did not read this paper,
instead the desciption in [Sorenson84] was used. Most compiler text books (e.g. [Waite84], [Aho86],[Wilhelm92])
do not include a description of this algorithm.</p>

TODO:
* IELR(1) - www.cs.clemson.edu/~jdenny/pages/publications/scp-2009.pdf
* more lookahead
* conflict handling
  o statically
    o by priority
    o by associativity
  o dynamically
    o user-defined predicate
    o make attributes available
  o automatically
    o transparently change the grammar
  o can I use the same declarations for scanner and ll and lr?
  o scanner conflicts are usually solved implicitly, using
    sequencing information; this may become explicit
  o other tools
    o Eli
      o offers to change the lookahead
    o lex, yacc, syntax
      o priority for token; inherited to productions
      o priority for productions
      o associativity
