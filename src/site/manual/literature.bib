  abstract=\{

Compiler Construction, a modern text written by two leaders in the in the
field, demonstrates how a compiler is built. Describing the necessary tools
and how to create and use them, the authors compose the task into modules,
 placing equal emphasis on the action and data aspects of compilation.
Attribute grammars are used extensively to provide a uniform treatment of
semantic analysis, competent code generation and assembly. The authors
also explain how intermediate representations can be chosen automatically
on the basis of attribute dependence. Thus, all aspects of the subject are
presented in terms of a uniform model subject to automation. This approach
imparts a vivid understanding of the compilation and the decisions
that must be made when designing a compiler.
